TODO
Use InheritableThreadLocal for RuleEngineData.
Use static for processor level map.
Call method is not taking arguments. See if processors can be pooled for avoiding instantiation overhead. 
Custom exception and better exception handling at processor failure for timeout.
See if same level process can be launched in parallel.
